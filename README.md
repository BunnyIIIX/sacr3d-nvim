# About

<div style="text-align: justify">
  sacr3d-nvim is a NeoVim plugin that provides multiple colorschemes based on
  the Challenger_deep colorschemes. This also based on Catppuccino color pallete and template.
  Apart from the eye-candy colorschemes, sacr3d-nvim also provides integrations with multiple
  plugins and tools you are probably already using (e.g. Treesitter, Native
  LSP, ...).

# üì¶ Installation

## Prerequisites

-   [NeoVim 0.5+](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

## Adding the plugin

You can use your favorite plugin manager for this. Here are some examples with the most popular ones:

### Vim-plug

```lua
Plug 'bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim'
```

### Packer.nvim

```lua
use "bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim"
```

### Vundle

```lua
Plugin 'bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim'
```

### NeoBundle

```lua
NeoBundleFetch 'bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim
```

## Setup

There are already some sane defaults that you may like, however you can change them to match your taste. These are the defaults:

```lua
colorscheme = "dark_sacr3d",
transparency = false,
term_colors = false,
styles = {
	comments = "italic",
	functions = "italic",
	keywords = "italic",
	strings = "NONE",
	variables = "NONE",
},
integrations = {
	treesitter = true,
	native_lsp = {
		enabled = true,
		styles = {
			errors = "italic",
			hints = "italic",
			warnings = "italic",
			information = "italic"
		}
	},
	lsp_trouble = false,
	lsp_saga = false,
	gitgutter = false,
	gitsigns = false,
	telescope = false,
	nvimtree = {
		enabled = false,
		show_root = false,
	},
	which_key = false,
	indent_blankline = false,
	dashboard = false,
	neogit = false,
	vim_sneak = false,
	fern = false,
	barbar = false,
	bufferline = false,
	markdown = false,
}
```

The way you setup the settings on your configuration varies on whether you are using vimL for this or Lua.

After setting things up, you can load sacr3d like so:

For Lua:

```lua
sacr3d.load(<colorscheme_name>)
```

If `<colorscheme_name>` is not passed then it'll pick the one in the config.

For VimScript:

```lua
colorscheme sacr3d
```

Passing `sacr3d` to the `colorscheme` command will pick the colorscheme in the config. Optionally, you could pass one by its code name (e.g. `colorscheme neon_latte`).

For instructions on how to configure the plugin, check out the [configuration](#configuration) section.

## Updating

This depends on your plugin manager. If, for example, you are using Packer.nvim, you can update it with this command:

```lua
:PackerUpdate
```

# ü§ñ Usage

## Commands

The provides commands that follows the _camel casing_ naming convention and have the `CP` prefix so that it's easy to remember that they are part of sacr3d-nvim:

-   `:CPClear` clear all highlight groups.
-   `:colorscheme <colorscheme_name>` load a colorscheme, not necessarily a sacr3d one. (Note: this is a built-in NVim command).

# üê¨ Configuration

Although settings already have self-explanatory names, here is where you can find info about each one of them and their classifications!

## General

This settings are unrelated to any group and are independent.

-   `colorscheme`: (String) code name of the color-scheme to be used. All of them can be found in the section below.
-   `transparency`: (Boolean) if true, disables setting the background color.
-   `term_colors`: (Boolean) if true, sets terminal colors (e.g. `g:terminal_color_0`).

## Styles

Handles the style of general hi groups (see `:h highlight-args`):

-   `comments`: (String) changed the style of the comments.
-   `functions`: (String) changed the style of the functions.
-   `keywords`: (String) changed the style of the keywords.
-   `strings`: (String) changed the style of the strings.
-   `variables`: (String) changed the style of the variables.

## Integrations

These integrations allow sacr3d to set the theme of various plugins/stuff. To enable an integration you just need to set it to `true`, however, there are some special integrations...

If you'd like to know which highlight groups are being affected by sacr3d, checkout this directory: [`lua/sacr3d/core/integrations/`](https://github.com/bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim/tree/main/lua/sacr3d/core/integrations).

### Special Integrations

-   **Native Nvim LSP:** setting `enabled` to `true` enables this integration. In the inner table (`styles`) you can set that the style for virtual diagnostics.
-   **Lualine:** use this to set it up (Note: `sacr3d` is the only valid theme name. It will pick the one set in your config):

```lua
require('lualine').setup {
  options = {
    theme = "sacr3d"
	-- ... the rest of your lualine config
  }
}
```

-   **Lightline:** use this to set it up (Note: `sacr3d` is the only valid colorscheme name. It will pick the one set in your config):

```lua
let g:lightline = {'colorscheme': 'sacr3d'}
```

-   **Kitty:** Copy and paste the file corresponding to theme you want to use from [this directory](https://github.com/bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim/tree/main/extra/kitty) on your Kitty config.
-   **Alacritty:** Copy and paste the file corresponding to theme you want to use from [this directory](https://github.com/bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim/tree/main/extra/alacritty) on your Alacritty config.
-   **NvimTree:** setting `enabled` to `true` enables this integration:

```lua
integration = {
  nvimtree = {
    enabled = true,
    show_root = true, -- makes the root folder not transparent
  }
}
```

## List of colorschemes

| Colorschemes     | Code Names         |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Dark sacr3d      | `dark_sacr3d`      |
| Neon Latte       | `neon_latte`       |
| Light Melya      | `light_melya`      |

## Overriding colors

To override the colors for the sacr3d theme you are using you'll pass the parameters to the `setup()` function you already used for configuring the plugin. This is the structure:

```lua
local sacr3d = require("sacr3d")
sacr3d.setup({<your_settings>}, {your_color_overrides})
```

Example: setting the colorscheme to `Neon Latte` and changing the color `red` to `#ffffff` (white).

```lua
local sacr3d = require("sacr3d")
sacr3d.setup({
  colorscheme = "neon_latte",
}, {
  red = "#ffffff",
})
```

All editable fields are the same as the ones mentioned in any of the colorschemes found at: [`lua/sacr3d/color_schemes`](https://github.com/bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim/tree/main/lua/sacr3d/color_schemes). You could also use one as a template, if you will.

## Hooks

Use them to execute code at certain events [described by their names]. These are the ones available:

| Function           | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `before_loading()` | Before loading a colorscheme |
| `after_loading()`  | After loading a colorscheme  |

They can be used like so:

```lua
local sacr3d = require("sacr3d")

sacr3d.before_loading = function ()
	print("I ran before setting a colorscheme!")
end
```

# üôã FAQ

-   Q: **_"How can I view the doc from NeoVim?"_**
    A: Use `:help sacr3d-nvim`

-   Q: **_"Why are the colorschemes named like that? Do they follow any convention(s)?"_**
    A: A colorscheme's name is constructed by two words: the first one is a word that represents the tonalities in the colors used and the second one is the name of a coffee drink from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_drinks).

# üëê Contribute

Pull Requests are welcomed as long as they are properly justified and there are no conflicts.

Also, when writing code for the project **you must** use the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/bunnyiiix/sacr3d-nvim/blob/main/.editorconfig) file on your editor so as to "maintain consistent coding styles".
